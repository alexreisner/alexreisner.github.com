"Informant":http://github.com/alexreisner/informant is a full-featured form builder for Ruby on Rails which promotes a simple syntax that keeps your views clean. Everything about a field (label, description, error display, etc) is encapsulated in a single method call. For example:

{% highlight erb %}
<%= f.text_field :name %>
{% endhighlight %}

renders something like this (in a field for a @@car@):

{% highlight html %}
<div id="car_name_field" class="field">
  <label for="car_name">Name</label><br />
  <input type="text" id="car_name" name="car[name]" value="" />
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

Each field can have a label, a required-field marker, some descriptive text, decoration (such as a spinner for AJAX calls), and more. Three form layouts are included (Standard, Table, and Simple), which can be easily customized. Informant will make your form code shorter and more readable.
