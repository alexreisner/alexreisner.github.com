Imagine deploying a web application without having to do any server configuration. In fact, imagine deploying a web application by simply uploading a collection of static HTML files.

* create open source services (pay for hosting, or run your own) for managing via AJAX:
  * comments (Disqus)
  * syntax highlighting (Gist, Pastie)
  * discussion (whatever Railscasts uses)
  * email delivery
* use CouchDB?

Benefits:

* no need to set up a optimized server for every app
* no need to build the same functionality into every app
