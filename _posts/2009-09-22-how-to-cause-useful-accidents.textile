title: How to Cause Useful Accidents

If you do any visual design work you've probably discovered that many of the best results happen by accident. I start designing in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop but I usually create HTML and CSS mockups of my designs pretty quickly. Part of the reason for this is that it makes semi-controlled mutations easier. That is, to _cause an "accident"_ I apply various unrelated stylesheets, just to see what happens. A polished final design never results, but good ideas often do.

It's difficult to do this in Photoshop or Illustrator, or any of the other visual layout/design tools I've used. Changes are usually applied to groups of objects or type, and even if you have you're using character or paragraph styles there's no easy way to apply _random_ changes, which is important because if you're _thinking_ about the mutations you will not cause an _accident_. Even taking stylesheets from your favorite (or least favorite) sites is somewhat premeditated, but it's worked pretty well for me, provided I don't use the same stylesheets over and over again on different designs.

Now, would someone please create a web site that generates random CSS and maybe even applies it to a page at a given URL? I'd like that very much.


PS: The folks at 37signals also "recommend working in HTML/CSS early":http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop, and they have some more good reasons to do it (ease of sharing/collaboration, experiencing interactivity, etc).
