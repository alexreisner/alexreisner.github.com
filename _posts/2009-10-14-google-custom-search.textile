If you want a Google-like search engine for your web site, why not use Google? For $100/yr (more if you have over 1,000 pages) you can get "access to Google search results":http://www.google.com/cse for your site in XML format. The google_custom_search gem helps you access this web service and publish the results on your site however you like (all covered under Google's acceptable use policy).

To perform a search:

{% highlight ruby %}
results = GoogleCustomSearch.search("Hank Aaron")
{% endhighlight %}

The @results@ variable is now a @GoogleCustomSearch::ResultSet@ object:

{% highlight ruby %}
results.total            # number of results (integer)
results.pages            # array of result objects
results.suggestion       # suggested search term, if any
{% endhighlight %}

Iterate through the results:

{% highlight ruby %}
results.pages.each do |result|
  result.title           # result title
  result.url             # result URL
  result.description     # excerpt, with terms highlighted
end
{% endhighlight %}
