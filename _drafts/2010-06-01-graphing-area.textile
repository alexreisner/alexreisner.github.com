bq. "We live in a world where the thorniest policy issues increasingly boil down to arguments over what the data mean. If you don’t understand statistics, you don’t know what’s going on — and you can’t tell when you’re being lied to. Statistics should now be a core part of general education. You shouldn’t finish high school without understanding it reasonably well — as well, say, as you can compose an essay." --"Clive Thompson":http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/st_thompson_statistics, May 2010

As a child I used to wonder if it was possible to read everything that was printed in the world, as it was published. I would imagine getting up in the morning, reading the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, the newspapers in Canada, Japan, Russia, China, etc, then moving on to any magazines that were published that week, then the works of fiction, the non-fiction, the academic journals, the reference books, and I would realize pretty quickly that it wasn't possible. But for some reason this imaginary game stayed with me for years. If you got together a group of people, how many would it take to read everything? How is it so hard to keep up with what's being written? Are there really that many writers and publishers?

Now that the Web is mainstream and there are millions of authors publishing every day, keeping up is even more daunting. And what about data? There are datasets out there, generated by automated sensors that record probably billions or trillions of numbers per day. I don't know how much electronic storage space exists in the world or how much of it is being used, but I think it's safe to say that there is more data generated in a day than one could consume in a lifetime.

Fortunately we don't need to read all the world's newspapers or datasets to get by in life. Through some process, part intuitive and part rational, we choose to read what we guess is relevant to us. This has a profound impact on how we see, think, and feel about the world. American newspapers paint a very different picture of the world than do Chinese newspapers. Liberal magazines have different values than conservative magazines. The sports section is different from the financial section, and fiction is different from documentary.

We absorb media because it is relevant to what we are doing (or because it is entertaining, but then is still usually relevant to our lives). A financial analyst will tend to read financial publications and watch financial news reports. A sports writer will read sports news and digest tables of sports data. I don't know exactly what kind of media world leaders are exposed to, but doubtless they are reading things that help them solve the problems they are working with.

Even if we can find sources of information that we like, we cannot trust them entirely. Writing is still done by humans (well, "mostly":computer-generated baseball game summaries), and humans make mistakes. Humans also have biases and agendas and they may try to convince us of something, subtly or overtly. We have to interpret the "facts," as told by our news sources, and try to decide whether they are true, based on our experience and all the other information (also subject to interpretation) that we have received during our lives. This is not an easy task, and it is one at which we are becoming increasingly lazy.

h2. Circles

It's hard enough to discern fact from almost-fact when we're reading words. In school we're (supposedly) trained to read words critically, but not numbers, and numbers are getting more and more prevalent in everyday discourse, often given extra authority by use of the word "statistics." Except for those of us who are trained statisticians, we are not equipped to understand statistics. *I include myself in this.* There are simply too many ways to manipulate numbers for any small table or one-liner to be at all meaningful, and yet we tend to believe, blindly, because there are numbers, and because somehow statistics equal truth.

(I believe it's a lack of fluency with statistical concepts like sample size, standard deviation, and confidence intervals that makes us unable to read numbers critically, but I'm not going to get any deeper into this here because it deserves an article of its own.)

Also becoming more prevalent in normal discourse are charts and graphs: tools for visualizing data sets. Thanks to more accessible graphing software, there is a growing number of authors who routinely include graphs with their work, and also those for whom graphs _are_ their work. Among this latter group are David McCandless, who runs a data visualization blog called "Information is Beautiful":http://www.informationisbeautiful.net. McCandless calls himself "an independent data journalist and information designer" and he has a very nice aesthetic sensibility. Most of the graphs on his site (created both by himself and others) are quite attractive, and they have appeared in reputable sources like "The Guardian":http://www.guardian.co.uk as well as in his two books of data graphics.

He also likes circles.

I like circles too, and I think most of us do. I think if people chose favorite shapes, the circle would be one of the most popular, if not the most. It's simple and yet powerful. It has the highest possible area-to-circumference ratio which makes it efficient, and it can be visually strong or soft, depending on context, so it's also quite versatile.

But the circle is *not* suitable for visualizing data, at least not in the manner of the current data graphics fashion. Let me illustrate with one of McCandless's recent charts from The Guardian (I'm going to pick on McCandless here, but he is only part of a larger trend):

!/images/content/mccandless_haiti.gif!:http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2010/haiti-earthquake-whos-given-what

Let's look at the left-hand column first, which shows total amount of money contributed by each country. Quickly now, look at the circles and answer these questions about the data:

# Did the US give twice as much as Canada?
# Did Canada give twice as much as Spain?
# Did Spain give twice as much as Germany? 

If you answered these questions by looking at the size of the circles you were wrong on #1, and probably on #3. Let's look at each of these questions more closely:

For #1: no, the US did not give twice as much as Canada. They gave just 28% more, but the US's circle on McCandless's chart is more than three times (300%) larger than Canada's. When I say "larger" I'm talking about surface area. Here are the areas of the circles (plus some other information):

It's kind of hard to tell that the US's circle is three times as large as Canada's, right? That's a problem if you want to understand and get a feel for the data quickly.

Another problem is illustrated by the _Pixels per $1m_ column in the table. If you want to build a readable graph your scale *absolutely cannot change*. Imagine building a model airplane that was part 1/32 scale and part 1/72. It wouldn't fit together, and this chart is no different. The shapes (the "graphical" elements) do not accurately represent the underlying data.

You probably got question #2 correct. Canada actually gave nearly three times as much as Spain. The area of its circle is _over_ three times that of Spain's, but it's fairly close and I don't think many people can tell the difference anyway.

!>/images/content/area_graphs.png!

If you got #3 correct you're very sharp. You're part of the minority who can compare geometric areas accurately. Spain gave 2.25 times as much as Germany and its circle is 1.95 times as large, which is not correct, but somewhat close. Again, not many people are capable of making this distinction. To most people (myself included) Spain's circle looks only slightly larger than Germany's. At right is my own illustration of the problem.

If we now look at the second and third columns in McCandless's chart ("Most giving people?" and "Most generous?") we see the same circles as in the first column. This seems suspicious even before closer examination. A quick look at the numbers in the third column should convince you that these circles are at least as inaccurate as those in the first column. Guyana gave .088% of its GDP, while Ghana gave .018%. That's nearly 5 times as much while its circle, as seen above, is just over 3 times as large. The rest of the circles are no better, and the scale is even more inconsistent than that of the left-hand column. In effect, the US's contribution in the first column gets overstated and Guyana's in the third column is understated. However, the entire chart is so misleading that this seems like a moot point.

To summarize, there are two major problems here:

# A lack of consistent scale in the shapes that represent the numbers.
# A visualization device (area of a circle) that hurts our ability to recognize problem #1.

Problem #1 is bad, and #2 is what is enabling its persistence in many graphics produced today.

In case you're curious, here are bar graphs of the data in the first and third columns. Remember that McCandless's circles are the same size, implying that the bars in each graph should be the same size:

h2. Rectangles, and Complacency

!>/images/content/gizmodo_server_chart.png!:http://gizmodo.com/5517041/googles-insane-number-of-servers-visualized

I have been aware for many years that people use the areas of shapes to convey quantity, but the first time I saw it done by a really credible source was Hans Rosling's "Gapminder":http://www.gapminder.org. Fortunately, Rosling uses the areas of circles to display tertiary data (population of countries) which is somewhat less important than the positions of his circles along conventional X and Y axes (each represents some user-selectable data related to health, environment, technology, wealth, politicts, etc). Nevertheless, the circles are there, and they should be read at one's own risk.

The area perception problem is not unique to circles. The chart at right, using rectangles, was posted on "Gizmodo":http://www.gizmodo.com and provoked a "good discussion in the comments":http://gizmodo.com/5517041/googles-insane-number-of-servers-visualized. Several readers point out the lack of consistent scale, and one goes as far as redrawing the chart using a consistent scale. The result is different (Google's share is noticeably smaller) but not that much more readable or useful.

My favorite comment is from a user named Merricat on April 14, 2010, who redraws the chart as a bar graph and adds an additional data point (see below, right). It's not that Merricat's graph is accurate (I'm pretty sure it's not, nor is it trying to be), but in posting it he skillfully points out that the original chart uses a data set that has been highly curated to make a specific point. This is extremely important to understand if we are to become statistically literate, but it deserves a separate article of its own. For now I am more concerned with the lack of readability in geometric areas, and the complacency it promotes.

I found the above chart through a link at the "O'Reilly Radar":http://radar.oreilly.com, the blog of technical publisher O'Reilly Media which has become an authority on technology and innovation over the past 30 years. They run a multitude of conferences and publish thousands of books, many of which I've purchased over the years because they tend to be the best on their subject. That O'Reilly's blog links to such a careless and misleading chart represents a real problem to me. It's one thing if David McCandless and Gizmodo are making attractive designs, adding some data, and calling it journalism. It's another that McCandless has published in The Guardian and that O'Reilly is buying Gizmodo's junk.

!>/images/content/merricat_graph.png!:http://gizmodo.com/5517041/googles-insane-number-of-servers-visualized

McCandless even says outright on his web site:

bq. "I’m interested in how designed information can help us understand the world, cut through BS and reveal the hidden connections, patterns and stories underneath. Or, failing that, it can just look cool!"

If that's not a dead giveaway that a source shouldn't be trusted, I don't know what is. Imagine the same sentiment offered by a writer:

bq. "I'm interested in how well-written articles can help us understand the world, cut through BS and reveal the hidden connections, patterns and stories underneath. Or, failing that, they can just sound good!"

If a writer said that they would be considered an author of fiction. For some reason we don't yet have the same standards for data graphic authors.

The data graphics we read shape our thoughts and decisions just as much as the words we read. Their expressive power necessitates an even higher degree of literacy. Most of us are pretty good at spotting words which are BS (as McCandless says), but we're not so good with numbers and that makes us lazy. This might sound harsh, but imagine moving to a new country and not bothering to learn the language. That would certainly be considered lazy, and probably rude. I don't think it's that different with statistics and visualizations, and it's getting us into trouble.



h2. Good Graphs

Veteran visualizer Edward Tufte says that graphs should help us make comparisons among data points ({cite one of his books}), and see things that we couldn't otherwise see. There is a real pleasure in reading a good chart, map, or graph. The best visualizations are the ones in which you can immerse yourself in the data, making comparisons, learning, and developing a feel for the numbers almost effortlessly. You are drawn into the graph, like you are drawn into a good story, and eventually you don't need the numbers because you are simply _there_, watching it unfold, experiencing the narrative.

Good graphs invite a multitude of thoughtful comparisons. Today's new wave of eye-candy charts usually just say: "look how big that one is!" They are products of laziness, not rigor.







[oil spill chart]

This chart is so difficult to follow that I would bet the majority of readers simply look for a prose explanation. Upon reading one, they will promptly believe it and move on. Deciphering the chart is simply not a productive use of time.

from http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/04/st_thompson_statistics:

"You need to train in this way of thinking. It’s not easy," says John Allen Paulos, a Temple University mathematician.

That’s precisely the point. We often say, rightly, that literacy is crucial to public life: If you can’t write, you can’t think. The same is now true in math. Statistics is the new grammar.
